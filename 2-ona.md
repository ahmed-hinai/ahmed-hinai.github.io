			<h2>Python for more than data analysis</h2>
		</header>
		<p>I was taught Python in my Physics degree to help with analyzing data and numerical integration. However, I was also using it to automate a few cumbersome for me, such as storing passwords locally. I always enjoyed these mini side-projects and thought it was finally time to build something bigger. </p>

					<h3>Oman News Agency</h3>
				</header>
				<p>One of the earliest applications I developed. The Agency had an application on the Store before, but it got removed; and their website was not optimized for mobile use, so I thought maybe I can build one. The app used the Kivy framework which is a UI SDK for Python. It used XML scraping to get the most recent articles from the ONA's RSS feed.</p>
