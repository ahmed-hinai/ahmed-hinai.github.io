		<p>This was my first glimpse at what professional app/software development might look like. I had recently been learning c++, so picking up Dart was easy, and using what I previously considered 'Heavy' IDEs such as VS code, made development so much easier. I had also previously put off using Git for version control, but now I don't see how I could have made this app without it. </p>

				<p>I wanted to automate away the routine of having to check and set your phone to silent before every prayer, and was very surprised to learn there were no android apps that did it, so I thought I will do it myself. Flutter made the front-end part a breeze. The most challenging aspect of developing this app was dealing with exact alarms and some OEMs hardline approach to killing apps running in the background.</p>
